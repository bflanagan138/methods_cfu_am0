# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
 + on a scale of 1 to 5, I'm about a 3. Need more practice
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
 + for simple methods, ok, but as they grow more complex I do still get lost.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
 + Not so much what can be done with methods, but what can't be accomplished with them? (this may be too vague)
